This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

cars <- mtcars
cars$cyl <- factor(cars$cyl, labels = 
                     c('Four cylinder', 'Six cylinder', 'Eight cylinder'))

features <- c('wt', 'qsec')
n_clusters <- 3
car_clusters <- kmeans(cars[, features], n_clusters, nstart = 30)

cars$cluster <- factor(car_clusters$cluster)

centroids <- data.frame(cluster = factor(seq(1:n_clusters)),
                        wt = car_clusters$centers[,'wt'],
                        qsec = car_clusters$centers[,'qsec'])

# cross tab of cylinder by cluster
print(table(cars$cluster, cars$cyl))

g <- ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = cars, 
             aes(x = wt, 
                 y = qsec,
                 color = cluster),
            size = 3) +
  geom_text(data = cars,
            aes(x = wt,
                y = qsec,
                label = row.names(cars),
                color = cluster),
            nudge_y = .2,
            check_overlap = TRUE) +
  geom_point(data = centroids,
             mapping = aes(x = wt,
                           y = qsec,
                           color = cluster),
             size = 20,
             pch = 13)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
